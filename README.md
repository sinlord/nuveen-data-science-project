Using AI for increasing Nuveen sales
Background:

Nuveen is a mutual fund company headquartered in Chicago, with major offices in New York City, Charlotte, San Francisco, London and secondary offices in Frankfurt, Los Angeles, Shanghai, Singapore, Rio de Janeiro, Vienna, Stockholm, Minneapolis, Montreal, Washington DC, Tokyo, Luxembourg, Madrid, Milan, Paris, and Miami. Nuveen is tasked with marketing and selling mutual funds through investment professionals such as brokers, financial planners, and financial advisors.

Nuveen was acquired by TIAA for $6.3B from its private equity owners in April of 2014. TIAA has over $1 trillion in assets under management and offers a wide range of financial solutions, including investing, banking, advice and education, and retirement services.

Business Model:
Nuveen charges investors a percent of assets under management (AUM). Therefore, the more that they sell, and the longer it stays in their mutual funds, the more revenue they receive.

Their goals are to acquire new clients cost-effectively, sell more to existing clients, reduce redemptions by acquiring, developing, and retaining (ADR).

It is likely that Nuveen has a relatively small percent of clients that account for a high percentage of their profit.
